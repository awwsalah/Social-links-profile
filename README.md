Social links profile front-end mentor challenge 

Code Review and what i learned from this challenge 
* Strengths:
    * Universal Reset: Ensures consistent styling across browsers and eliminates unexpected default margins and padding.
    * CSS Variables: Improves maintainability and facilitates theming.
    * Smooth Transitions: Button hover effect includes a transition for a polished user experience.
    * Responsive Design: The media query ensures the layout adapts to different screen sizes.
* Areas for Improvement:
    * Naming Conventions: Some CSS variables (e.g., --forground-color) could be more descriptive for better readability.
    * Organization: Consider using a CSS preprocessor (like Sass or Less) for nesting and better organization, especially as the project grows larger.
    * Comments: Adding comments to explain non-obvious styling choices or the purpose of media query breakpoints would enhance future code understanding.
Summary
The provided CSS code demonstrates a good foundation for styling a web page. It effectively uses the following fundamentals:
* CSS reset to normalize browser inconsistencies.
* CSS variables for maintainable color theming.
* Basic layout and styling for containers, cards, buttons, text elements, and images.
* A media query to provide basic responsiveness for smaller screens.
